# Gas-Monitor
The MQ2 sensor is commonly used for detecting gas levels (such as LPG, smoke, alcohol, propane, hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide). Here's a step-by-step guide to create an Arduino project using the MQ2 sensor to measure air quality and print the values to the serial monitor.

# Components Needed
1)Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega)
2)MQ2 gas sensor
3)Breadboard
4)Jumper wires
5)USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer

# MQ2 Sensor Pins:
VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino.
GND: Connect to GND on the Arduino.
A0: Connect to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino.
